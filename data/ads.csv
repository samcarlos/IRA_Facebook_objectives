A man in Alabama collapsed and died after officers sprayed him with pepper
spray while arresting him after a chase, Tuscaloosa police said Saturday.

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they
caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more
commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The Chemical agent
debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's
nose and throat.

The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during
an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and
body camera footage of the incident would be released after that
investigation.

This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish
death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is
dead and there is no Chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever,

“Do black females lives matter, too?”

That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on

plague black women every day.

“Black features are beautiful, black women are hot,” Stenberg wrote. “White

fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding
black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty
standards.”

Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all

A teenager shot by City police is paralyzed below the waist, his mother said
Sunday as her family copes with another episode of gun violence. Not seven

This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an
officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 pm. Saturday in a housing
complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police
encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen
pistol.

His mother said that she respected the police and that her son “shouldn’t
have had the gun.” But from what witnesses have told her, she said, “They
didn’t have to shoot him down like that.”

One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did
have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at
anyone as he tried to run from officers.

When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a
black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun) - he'll be immediately shot by

addition, Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For

Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 am. on Friday, hearing reports

Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation

Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said.

pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect
crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King

Police officer Jeff Willis is facing disciplinary action after a video surfaced of
him violently threatening teenagers because they were smiling at him and not
taking him seriously enough. Willis pulled them over because one of the
passengers allegedly flipped him the middle fighter from the window.

When one of the young men asks the officer “What did I do?” the officer
responds by saying, “I don’t know. Ijust don’t like you, Ijust don’t like you.""

The only crime committed by the occupants of the car was shooting the video.
We have a legal right to film and photograph police, in every state! People
should know their rights - it's the first step to stop police brutality.

If another person smiling makes you that upset, you should not be permitted
to own a gun. People, who have mental illness or anger issues should not
having access to guns. Guns should be in the hands of responsible adults!

Police went out of the control. How much respect do you think Police has for
people? 0! In this way, if you can't control yourself it's time to retire, you don't
deserve to carry the badge.

America needs better gun control. Although, it's not the type of gun that is the
problem. It is the type of gun owner that is the problem. America, control your

What the police ruled ""natural causes"" turned out to be that he starved to

been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a
zebra cake, a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth,
Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge.

wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in
his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a

eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health

Autistic Teen Unconscious

During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force
against him at the Green Line’s Lexington Parkway Station.

The teen suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, which causes him to strongly
dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered
legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses.

Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify
forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left
unconscious.

Abrams non-compliance wasn’t done out of malice, but out of not really
understanding the situation, and believing he hadn’t done anything wrong.
Abrams’ autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions
or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the
custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility.

Police are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they
prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything
else, including that of the citizens they allegedly “protect and serve.”

however, police officers would face neither criminal nor Civil prosecution for

allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers
responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed
Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to
intervene.

Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid “was
reasonable under the Circumstances,” but the burden of demonstrating that
this is the case is placed upon the accused.

National Mall in Washington, DC answering the call from Minister Louis
Farrakhan to come to the nation's capital and show our strength in numbers
and unity and remind politicians that our voices would be heard. 20 years
later, we return to call on our politicians to fix our broken criminal justice
system once and for all.

| march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than
there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local
prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is
an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that
disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white
people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry
off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't
video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that
criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before
they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on
incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a
system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world.
To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school
discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that
targets communities of color by programs like ""Stop & Frisk"" or ""Broken
Windows.""

Ten people were killed and seven were wounded Thursday in a shooting at a
small community college in Roseburg, Oregon. The shooting took place in
Classrooms in Snyder Hall.

Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man
responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three
handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a
fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition.

One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people’s
religions before he began firing.

The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34,
and quoted a doctor who said that an ""army"" of doctors and nurses had
volunteered to help.

It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is
the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few
months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn’t it time for some
gun control yet?

Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported
BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This
dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a
few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's
white. And honestly, word ""shooting"" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it
terror? Oh, wait. White male though...

*CLICK TO GET LIVE UPDATES ON OUR PAGE*

A white gunman opened a fire at pastor and 8 other Church members at black
Church in Charlestone, SC on Wednesday night. The young Clean-shaved
shooter walked in during a prayer meeting and started shooting the people.
Charleston Police Chief Greg Mullen said that the incident would be
investigated as hate crime.

Emanuel AME Church is a historically Africa-American Church which was
found by Denmark Vesey in order to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

Despite the first black American president, Africa-Amerioans remain the most
common victims of hate crimes. But what if the hate crime relates to
xenophobia? American xenophobia is based on the dominant white heritage
that is giving birth to another form of hate and discrimination. These forms
take another level of hate. Unfortunately, American tolerance is not what we
think it is. US public is swapping patriotism for nationalism, tolerance for
Islamophobia, racism and anti-immigrant sentiment. For instance, last
February American gunman killed three young Muslims two miles away from
the University of North Carolina campus. Was this gunman motivated by hate
and intolerance? Should we expect for more hate-Crimes?

What if American racial Change sti|| occurs through generations? What of it
racism happens due to unequal opportunities? What if America is still a

Rachel Dolezal drew attention to her racial identification. A white-born former
NAACP leader Claimed to be black. The criticism towards Dolezal stems
controversy around her identity and her position as the president of the
NAACP in Washington. Today, Dolezal sees herself as first transracial.

Rachel Dolezal stated that her racial identity was black, American Indian,
white and two more races. Moreover if she proves that she is black, than
anyone else will be able to prove that he/she is not even a human being.

This black family from Ohio will never forget the June 9th. According to the
family‘s testimony, Krystal Dixon and her sister Maya Dixon took their eight
Children, nephews and nieces to Ohio public school in a Fairfield.
Nevertheless, the pool employee demanded the family to leave due to one of
the Children did not have swim trunks. One of the boys broke the rules and
the staff asked the family to leave. As six-months pregnant Krystal Dixon
walked to the parking lot, the police officer grabbed her arm and asked for an
ID-oard. The witness video shows how the police officer pepper sprayed
Dixon‘s family and grabbed 12-year-old Child by neck. But according to the
Fairfield police department, the white police officer did not use excessive
force.

Did the pool staff force them to leave because they were black? Was it a race
factor? Don‘t you think the police officer‘s attempt to arrest Krystal Dixon was
unlawful? How the police officers should be Charged? What kind of right of
defense do you have against unlawful arrests?

These days, there is far more to being a “good cop” than Choosing not to hurt
innocent people. Plus, when are we going to stop being stereotypical? Even
today, the stereotypes effect black population of the United States of America
transmitted through music, lyrics, titles, literature, movies and folk saying.
White Americans across the country embrace African-Americans the image of
criminals and |ooters. How are we going to live with that?

On Sunday evening, hours after Emanuel AME. Church opened its doors for
the first service following the killing of nine of its congregants Wednesday,
thousands in Charleston took to the streets in a show of support and
solidarity.

Observers on the bridge, and thousands more at the base, joined hands to
create a ""unity chain,"" then held a moment of silence that lasted five minutes
in honor of the fallen.

Police estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 took part in Sunday’s gathering,
according to the Post and Courier. Cars drove slowly past the bridge, taking in
the sight and honking horns in solidarity as people chanted “Charleston
strong!”

Throughout history people start to unite only when they face danger or when
they're in times of great sorrow. Modern America is accustomed to meet only
imaginary dangers, however, Americans are getting more and more reasons
to sorrow over something day by day.

Does it mean that the key to the unity of 330 million Americans is constant
fear and unending sorrow? Does it mean that only this can make Americans
unite and forget about the infighting and differences? Unfortunately, yes, it
does.

Cornel West called him the first ""niggerized"" president in an appearance on
CNN. West criticized Obama as ""a person who is afraid and intimidated when
it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy.""

""A niggerized black person is a black person who is afraid and scared and
intimidated when it comes to putting a spotlight on white supremacy and
fighting against white supremacy,"" West explained. ""So when many of us said
we have to fight against racism, what were we told? 'No, he can't deal with

racism because he has other issues, political calculations. He's the president
of all America, not just black America.‘ We know he's president of all America

West is right as usual. African minorities would Choose Mr. West in 2009 and
2012 instead of Obama. But we had no Choice. Cornel is a good leader, he
knows what black community is suffering from. Obama was promoted by big
corporations owned by white people. Obama never tried to protect blacks
from police pressure, never tried to stop police violence against blacks. Just
count how many black lives were destroyed during his presidency. The

percent for Iran deal. And now they Claim enourmous victory.

Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the

Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding long-
term agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of
dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed.

Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been
obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can
never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in
2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and
the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama.

But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to Change a
subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be
treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and
the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his
presidential veto.

The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to
overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So,
instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67
senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or

support the deal.

Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will
simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking
and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42
percent.

Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn’t care
about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions.

Andy Hallinan, a Florida gun shop owner has banned Muslim customers from
his store. He declared his shop a “Muslim-free zone” in response to a
shooting in Chattanooga, where a Kuwait-born terrorist killed five US Marines.
Hallinan announced his store’s new policy sitting against the Confederate

What we can say? Hallinan is completely right! If the government cannot
provide our security, then we must do everything possible to provide it. A lot
of Muslims become Islamists, who pose a real threat to our national security.

Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of

national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments
liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.

Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist

racism, against those who want to destroy America!

too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps
new terrorist attacks won’t be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more
terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won’t be tightened.

US. Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado said in a statement
that he was alarmed by the reports of an FBI alert that relatives of the US
military personnel in Wyoming and Colorado were harassed outside their
homes by Middle Eastern men and might have been under surveillance. A
copy of the alert said that the wife of a US. military member was approached
in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May.
Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June.

We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the US. military
has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are
doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don’t fully perform their duties.
First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to
identify people who scour after the wives and Children of the US. Military.
Secondly, families of the US. Military should be taken under special

almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.
He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its
historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he
was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless
advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the
Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a
government that improves the lives of the people it serves.”

her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.

contrast, Obama ordered the flags to haIf-staff following on the same day that
as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered
to haIf-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon,

the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of
Nelson Mandela. But it hasn’t yet been lowered in honor of the service

members murdered in Tennessee.

soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not

deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is
necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as

This resolution will allow chartered organizations to select adult leaders

The Vatican has rejected a request by a transgender man in Spain to become
a godparent, ruling that his sexual identity means he is incapable of carrying
out the task.

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the
bishop of his local diocese on Spain’s southern coast questioned his gender
identity.

Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and
has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery.

Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family’s request
to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote
to the Vatican for advice.

Zornoza published the Vatican’s reasoning for rejecting Salinas’ wish.

It said transsexual behavior “reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to
the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the
truth of one’s own sexuality.”

The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't
allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time,
the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just
another superstition of Church. Funny.

discriminated against by local authorities in Louisville, Ky.

There's a gap between Kentucky law and federal law. People trying to Change
the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery.

But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical
reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these
people’s Circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats.

It is very important for every transgender to be able to Change his\her
identification to reflect who they really are. It’s not just about person dressed
as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is
about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man
or woman on|y presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they
were assigned to at birth.

Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification
Changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible.
Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you
were assigned to at birth.

the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his

Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: ""I don’t think his

he is.

Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the
creators of the new ""Star Wars"" for the incredible courage and opposition to
conservative bias in Hollywood Cinema. There should be a special
organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There
should be at least one gay Character in every movie in order to help the
American society get rid of homophobic stereotypes.

Passing the “First Amendment Defense Act” introduced by Sen. Mike Lee
has been anti-LGBT oonservatives’ top priority since the Supreme Court
brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It’s part of the National
Organization for Marriage’s post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential

Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does
is enable anti-gay discrimination.

Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against
religious institutions — for discriminating against people in same-sex
marriages. It’s the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government
never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex
couple’s marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them.

Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that

Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to

they’re thus the real victims.

There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having
a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do

He said: “I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend
and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We’re very

Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players
spoke of killing gay people

Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014
Major League Baseball draft and given a Chance to pursue his dream of being
in the big leagues. But afterjust one season pitching for a Cardinals minor
league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during
his playing days, he was a Closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable
environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging
reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew
Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US.

parents first reaction probably will be “How will I ever handle this?” The
answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help
to understand your Child’s sexuality and its meaning to you and your
continued relationship with your son or daughter.

Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their
Child’s sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as
problem-free — overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during
that time.

Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening — by rejecting what they're
hearing (“It’s just a phase; you’ll get over it”); by shutting down (“If you
Choose that lifestyle, I don’t want to hear about it”); or by not registering the
impact of what we’re being told (“That’s nice, dear, and what do you want

for dinner?”).

Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT Children. If
you as a parent 'll pretend to forgot the truth about your child’s sexuality, you
would never really know your Child. A large part of his or her life would be kept
secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person.

It is important to accept and understand your child’s sexuality because
homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment
for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of
telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through ""a phase"".

On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding
and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you’re wondering, “ls
she/he sure?” the answer will almost always be “yes”!

“traditional marriage” or infringing on their religious liberty.

Yet in the months surrounding the recent US. Supreme Court decision to

Superman action figures when they were little, I played with barbies... I

National Organization for Marriage is asking all of the GOP presidential
candidates to sign an anti-equality pledge. Let’s take a look at just how crazy
this pledge gets.

That’s just nuts! They want candidates to support a constitutional
amendment to ban marriage nationwide. This will never happen. For the last
decade public support for marriage equality has gone from 35 percent to 55
percent!

But they don’t stop there. NOM also wants candidates to “work to overturn
any Supreme Court decision” in favor of the freedom to marry. NOM wants
the president to only nominate judges who will uphold marriage bans, but at
this point, legal consensus so strongly supports marriage equality that
supporting marriage bans is a sign that person isn’t qualified to be a judge.

Also, NOM wants the candidates to weaken Civil rights laws, creating
loopholes to let companies and Citizens to discriminate if they Cite a religious
justification. That could actually happen — and it already has in some states —
so it’s a huge concern.

And fifth, they want the Department of Justice to investigate harassment
against people who oppose marriage equality. Sure, gays and lesbians are
harassed every day, fired, kicked out of their homes and schools, separated
from theirfamilies, but I really hope soon there’ll be NO MORE of it!

There’s a part of me that feels very sad for NOM’s fanatics. When they
finally kick the bucket, they’ll be dealing with the reality (whether they openly
face it or not) that their Life’s Work has amounted to NOTHING. Nothing they
worked for made anyone’s life better. At all.

They didn’t win, and they wasted their lives fighting against the inevitable.
And when they’re dead and gone, they’ll be remembered only as footnotes
in shameful history — or more likely they ‘ll be forgotten completely.

After all, it was Trump who promised to put America First and promised to end
Obama’s policy of wasting budget money on military operations overseas.
“We’re not going into Syria”, Trump said it to calm down those who got really
concerned about a possibility of America getting involved into another war. I
really want to trust these words, but unfortunately many high-ranked
politicians want to force Trump to pull America into another war.

Here’s what Ron Paul thinks about it: “By the end of this month, Defense
Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will
deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan,
Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send
his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There
is no way another “surge” in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria)
puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will
succeed any better than it did the last time.”

Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and
why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We’ve started the whole Afghanistan
thing to beat the Soviets, and no there’s no Soviet Union on the world map,
and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian
students.

presence in Syria now doesn’t serve American interests. Our soldiers are
there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for

opposite to the “America First” concept.

I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and
weeks after weeks of Trump’s presidency there are no Changes in that
direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and
today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis
want to use Trump’s influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli
sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he’s trying make a deal out of it,
but there’s one important thing here: under no Circumstances can our
soldiers’ lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential
campaign Trump said “let’s bring back our soldiers home”, and now it’s
really time to do it. This is not our war.

was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,
Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on
and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking
him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or
violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.
Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American
police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.
Very ridiculous.

there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even

gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from Civilians. You can be put
behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one’s life
becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making
a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all
these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums
of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn’t pay a fine.

gay Club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even
if it’s evident. There’s a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or
just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But
if you are in a member of a Club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your
secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other
cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the
misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally
withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper
administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly
enough, “Sworn officer of the court” is most likely to lie than the Citizen he is
even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code
of silence, and it’s a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is

The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black
community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by

no time, “White Power” will be stronger than before.

This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation’s
poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system
houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a
little on how it’s going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built
additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have
taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he
Chose prisons. It’s not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind
bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.

LITTLE BLACK BOY

The shocking video shows a Central Texas Child trying to get up from a bean
bag Chair in his Classroom, while a Snook Independent School District
employee, Troy Vahn pushing him repeatedly into it and mocking him again
and again.

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher
manhandling a small Child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was
shared thousands of times.

In the video footage, Vahn also tells the boy: “Tell me no. When | tell you to
do something, you do it, boy.”

After the Burleson County Sheriff‘s Office launched an investigation, a
“behavior specialist” who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young
student was fired.

The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the
students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who
abuse any Child. The teachers who use excessive force against any Child
should be removed immediately from the Classroom and placed on
administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen.

Disturbing video shows Sung Ho Lim, an owner of Missha Beauty (in
Charlotte, NC), kicked and choked a Black woman!

This man absolutely crossed the line! According to Lim, he saw the
unidentified woman stealing eyelashes. But, in the video, you can hear the
woman tell Lim, “Check my bag. I’m telling you I don’t have anything.” And
why did he attack her? Did he try arrest her or what?

Corine Mack of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Chapter of the NAACP demanded
that Lim apologize to the Black community in Charlotte. But folks, lwant it be
not only the boycott of this exact store but all shops and stores where Black
people were treated disrespectfully! We don’t believe apologies, especially
when we know that this man is sorry only about profit he's going to lose!

VIDEO SHOWS THEM KICK BLACK MAN DURING TRAFFIC STOP

Two Georgia police officers have been fired after police released the footage
of the encounter where two Gwinnett County cops kicking a black college
student during a traffic stop.

According to a police report, 21-year-old Demetrius Ho||ins was pulled over
near Lawrenceville for Changing |ines several times without signaling. When
cops stopped him, Ho||ins was seen on video standing with his hands raised
before one of the officers was seen punching the motorist in his face, and the
second cop racing to the scene later, only to stomp Ho||ins in his face.

The 21-year-old man said he feared for his life when he saw police approach
him. Ho||ins raised his hands up in order to let him know that he didn‘t have
anything where he could hurt him, but police beat him. Moreover, after the
incident cops wrote in their police report that Ho||ins resisted arrest and
Claimed that Ho||ins refused to place his hands behind his back and resisted
arrest. Cops |itera||y lied and had no shame.

This incident embarrassed and the Gwinnett County police and all law
enforcement. They should be held accountable for their actions. Resignation
is not the answer. We did not hear any criminal Charges, even though they
admit the cops broke the law. Where is the justice? FINALLY! TWO

ARE YOU READY FOR A FLASH MOB, BLACKTIVISTS?

If Hillary and her party have done so much for us, why is poverty increasing in
the black community? Why we can‘t see economic development? Why there
are no jobs for us? Why black unemployment rate is twice as the national
average? She wasn‘t for us here before the elections, remember? If these

questions are asked more often, it will be another disappointing Election Day
for Hillary Clinton.

Take part in this flash mob and show everybody that no one can manipulate
black voters.

DROP CHARGES, CITING DOUBLE RISK

North Charleston police officer Michael Slager, who shot and killed 50-year-
old Scott after an April 2015 traffic stop, and his attorneys urged the court to
drop murder Charge due to the double jeopardy that Slager faced before the
shooting. According to ex-cop‘s attorneys, their defendant acted in self-
defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,
hitting Scott five times from behind.

Slager‘s defense attorney‘s:

“The doubIe-teaming of Slager is a chilling example of how far politically
motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather
their own nests at the expense of a public servant who had to make a split-
second life or death decision that will be seoond-guessed by comfortable
armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.”

The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken
brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager‘s
dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him
about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott
jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a
bystander‘s video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.

We‘ve seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead
black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none
of them found guilty. That‘s why today it‘s important to send a message to
other police officers that if they do this, it‘s harsh penalty to pay.

Of course, many of you will scoff at comparing 49ers quarterback Colin
Kaepernick to Martin Luther King Jr., who also demanded better from America
in 1966. But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the
national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating
to the Black Youth Project 100.

Kaepernick donated to the Chicago Chapter of the organization toward
“Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to
Build Black Futures” which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all
Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States
of America.

“I’ll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what
are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those
communities,” he said.

When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there
is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don‘t really care
about haters.

Goodjob, Colin.

STRUGGLED WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER

Michelle Lee Shirley was fatally shot by Torrance police officer as she
approached a group of police officers in her car.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were
warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,
who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.
When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at
her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting.

After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor—UCLA Medical Center
and was pronounced dead.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to
balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, “It‘s Up to Us,” she
was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because
ignoring it can take away years of people‘s lives.

Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be
killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half
of people shot by cops are mentally ill?

Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the
field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals.

hair, the US. Army again lifted the ban on dreadlocks that was instated in
April 2014.

The ban faced an instant backlash from black women so the Army unbanned
braids and twists amidst the criticism.

Some of the female soldiers used harsh Chemicals to keep their hair straight.
Moreover, every eight weeks it cost them to $80. Thus, the ban on dreadlocks
caused a lot of unnecessary stress.

The ban on loos, which was part of Army Regulation 670-1, remained until
January 2017. The new rules offered female soldiers another hairstyle option.
Now the rules allow dreadlocks and looks but only if they are less than a half-
inch wide.

Well, it took months for the Army to recognize that black women have
different hair texture.

Two Michigan Black police troopers who recently won lawsuit in racial

again, Claiming they faced the same issues.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever
since they returned to work, they have been subjected to petty attacks and
denied attempts in promotion.

Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police
department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper
Ha|| received a “need improvement rating,” his squad car was taken away,
and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall, police
trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended
on the basis of race.

Once again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately, black police officers
still remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police
department despite the fact that we live in a “post-racial” society.

On October 10, 2015 in Washington, DC, at the National Mall, The
Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan will convene the 20th Anniversary of the
Million Man March under the theme: Justice or Else!

“The Million Man March was one of the most historic organizing and
mobilizing events in the history of Black people in the United States,” said
Chicago—based Dr. Conrad Worrill, who was a main organizer of the March
and the current president emeritus of the National United Black Front.

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on
Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that
something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition.
We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a
united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick
Douglas said “ Power concedes nothing except by a demand”. Our demand
of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the
brotherhood.

It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters.

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted
about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police
officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses, he was so mad about
the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

Abdulwalia‘s anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some
apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should
not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was
trying to send: having a black president Changes almost nothing.

For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those
killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation
proceeds.

Nothing will bring the victims of Charleston massacre back, but this money
will help aid in bridging the gap in the loss of an income. Donations are
important for these families since they did not receive a cent from the
government.

HAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF

The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he
had a “medical episode” at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark
from one cell to another. According to police reports, Arial J. Clark, 31, was
too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.

On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark, reporting
that Clark, who was driving his wife and two Children from Buffulo to Texas,
was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark‘s wife said that a man and his
son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he
hadn‘t slept in five days. When the police arrived, Clark was arrested, taken
to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint Chair for his
combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some
breathing difficulties and deputies started Chest compression. But an hour
later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail
inmate.

Now the question is whether the jail‘s standard operating procedures were
followed.

We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after “fighting” with
the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at
hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in
police custody.

We all know that black communities and Natives have always been plagued
by an array of issues that we have to deal on a daily basis. Watching
America’s reaction to racism is very telling. Last year, police brutality and
racism have made it t the forefront. Hundreds of unarmed black men and
women died at the hands of police officers.

We are tired to feel neglected and ignored. We all have had enough. And now
we need to come together, be honest and get the government‘s attention.

This Surah is an evidence of how Syrian refugees respect our culture. If you
think that Muslims ignore some Islamic rules, you're wrong. For example, a
Muslim in eastern Uganda strangled his Christian wife to death this month for
leaving Islam.

What would you do if your wife or husband converts to Islam? Probably you

happened the night a Chicago.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,
brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home, when Morsi-
Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and
demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license,
Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor
Brown, who was beat and pepper—sprayed by police. Brown is not the only
victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.

The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why
the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held
personally and financially responsible for their actions.

Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards Civilians in a combat
zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another
attitude to people in blue?

a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them.

trigger two more times. As usual, no Charges were ever filed against the

Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she
realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face
is priceless.

The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for
illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who
had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The
driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under
threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.

The sheriff’s office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11
years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that
how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix
the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer
is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not
have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.

To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.
Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give
our Citizens a Chance to get back home alive.

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will
get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

forbidden from ever owning any firearm again, period!

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to
take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are
judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,

it is theirjob to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot
someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their

eyes.

It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the
difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will

get away with it.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand
that theirjob is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,
they understand that they are not the jury and this is not theirjob.

Bad that America trained not like this!???

who said they were attacked outside a convenience store this weekend in
what police are investigating as a possible hate crime.

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which
occurred shortly after 3 am. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21st St.
That’s just northeast of the Wichita State University campus.

One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is
a 19-year-old student who has Chosen to remain anonymous.

They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 am. Saturday when they
noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas
money.

When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him
for money, one of the students attempted to intervene.

The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his
motorcycle in front of Usama’s car and approaching Usama’s friend, who
had gotten out of the car.

The suspect called his friend “brown trash” and told him he had to “leave this
country,”

According to Usama’s account, his friend responded: “This is my country.
Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?”

The incident “escalated really quick,” with the suspect attempting to punch
his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said
he was assaulted and knocked down.

He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode Circles around
the two students, Chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!” and screaming, “We’ll
make America great again! We’ll throw you out of the wall!”

Dear Mrs. Clinton,

We are trying not to be political, but the current presidential elections and the

rise of hate against Muslims made us realize that it is time to stand and let our
voices be heard.

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential
campaign, but did you support us before campaign?

We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and
Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused
hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their
homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women
and Children, to die in their homes, and for what?

Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill A|-
Gaddafi. You said in an interview: ""We came, we saw, he died"". Let's not
forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security,
and that caused the death of the US. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens
and US. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and
CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were
also injured in the attacks.

You killed Saddam Hussein and Al-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the
countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat
not only to the US. but the whole world!

You are supporting gun control, disarming the American Citizens and at the
same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders,
creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Syria.

8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years
ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You Change
your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry,
but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United
States.

Sincerely,
United Muslims of America

The fact that he is gone is difficult to come to terms with; for years, Ali was
renowned as a larger than life figure, the greatest, as he called himself, and
the demise of a man of such a high stature is surely a void that can never be

In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing
legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular
culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came
to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things
unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.

He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War.
Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was
accused of committing a felony.

Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot
be filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!!

Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all

soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white
soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance.
Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the

up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She
became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of
today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child
is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck
for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea. I guess
she deserved to be a queen after what she had experienced. Black people

powerful weapon.

Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over
the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,
eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5
million in cash, according to a press release. “It would be safe to say that the
money would be taken back to Mexico, and that’s where the source of the
cocaine was,” special agent Tim Stone said.

This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which
makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to
prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The
most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as
unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as
they can.

At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government
officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get
filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.

Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only
hope for a better future!

strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more Civilians. Just to make it
Clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government
agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this
is more and more Civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development
programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services,
Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in
their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%.
However, terrorists weren’t destroyed in ’30 days’ and it seems like they
won’t be destroyed in the Closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will
do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war ‘for freedom’, it’s
another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood
money is the main goal of it. For America, another continuous military conflict
can lead to a financial crisis, this is exactly what happened in 2008.

you for the supportive donation to our schools. As we all know, CPS has been
struggling financially, and your donation has really given us a push to get to
where we need to be and possibly motivate others to give back to the
community as well. This is only one of the many things that you have done to
improve our Chicago...

All of the things that you do for our City never go unnoticed. All of the free
concerts you host and all the time you spend here in the City really show you
care. We notice it. We look up to you because the fame usually takes humility
away from artists, but it hasn’t Changed you...

We thank you for supporting Chicago's minority youth when not many others
have put time to think about the kids. As minority students we feel ignored
and as though we don’t have enough support from bigger influences like you.
Being born and raised in Chicago is not easy at all. There are so many
stereotypes and restrictions we have as teenagers clue to the frequent
violence and crimes. Your music puts some at ease because we know that
someone cares and someone has experienced these daily struggles too. You
and your music have taught us that you can be true to yourself and still be
successful, still be self-made...

Once again, thank you for aiding us and giving something back to the City we
know and love, Chicago.

Sincerely,

Alex Rojas, Alondra Cerros, and Annelisse Betancourt

Lake View High School Students

Chicago, Illinois""

It's not the full letter, but some extracts. lt's sweet to observe how young
people don't hesitate to express their gratitude and respond to someone who
cares for them. We are sure, that Chano needs it. Love should be given back.
It should work.

As an independent artist he got people's support and Chance didn’t forget
who made him famous. Artists are made of talent, work and people’s love.
That’s cool that this love goes back and forth!

We need more of these positive black people on the media, because some
people forget how much love and care black people show. Hopefully one day
different race will be the issue of diversity, not stereotypes.

members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in
summer of 1968. The shop was selling the books of black writers. The next
year the owners of Drum and Spear launched its own publishing company.
One of co-founders said “We don’t define profit in terms of money. The profit
is the patronage of the community, which allows the store to seIf-support.”
Drum and Spear was aimed to show people the true black culture and history,
something beyond the American school program. It's reflected in the name of
the shop: the drum is for “communications within the diaspora,” and the
spear symbolizes “whatever else might be necessary for the liberation of the
people.”

The best-sellers of early 70s in this shop were such books as the
Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice.

This bookstore inspired people around the country to open similar bookstores.
Drum and Spear and many other stores were not only the shops, but a ""free
spaces"" for thinking black people where folks could meet and discuss the vital
issues. Let's not forget our legacy! We need this drum and we need this spear

To improve Leon’s skills of painting he began to attend art Classes of R.
Gregory Christies. Non-profit organization the Southwest Atlanta Youth
Business Organization (SWAYBO) also helped Leon in many ways.
According to blacknews.com, the organization gave him lessons of “poise

how to perform basic accounting formulas. With SWAYBO, Leon has met
judges, successful business owners and other pillars of the Black

community.”
Now Moss makes illustrations and sells the copies of his works. The first book

A recent study has revealed some surprising differences in credit scores
between African-Americans and Caucasians.

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were
likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between

$65,000 and $75,000 per year.

Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to
Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to African-

Americans.

Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some
researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

the people that come to court come from all different walks of life, different
ethnic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds.""

However, if it's a sign of diversity, this is a very weak sign. Just think, we are
indigenous inhabitants of this land and we were cut off all privileges since
gabachos came and stole our land. So, it took almost 500 years for our
woman to reach a prestigious position in the government that is not really

Charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.

It is not Clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards
Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.

Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how |ibera| propaganda
influences even on Southern people.

The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be
blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American
history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people’s respect.

It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect

The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans’ issues was
in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans’ life
improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are

some real Clinton decisions:

—Last year, Clinton Claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had

been exaggerated by Republicans.
—In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007
supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans’

medical care.
-In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20

million for veterans’ health care facilities.
-In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for “$13 billion
for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.”

In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the
poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the
issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they
need so bad!

Hardly will she Change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a
direct threat to the American veterans’ society, but still practically no one
raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!

Victoria King was pulled over by officer Timothy Isaacs for a bad tail light.
The situation escalated quickly when the police officer demanded King to roll
down her window ""all the way” to receive her ticket. When King refused,
which by the way was a perfectly legal thing to do, the police officer broke out
the car window and arrested her in a brutal way. Instead of simply Citing her,
the police officer demanded the woman to obey and threw her to the ground.

the most political courage”. He said that sending troops to Syria was a very
difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama
was hated for not taking actions, but it’s better for being hated for not killing
innocent people that for starting a useless war.

Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that
would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed.
Unfortunately, the recent government didn’t think twice, before they started
bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill
innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?!

followed with rage and persecution; so that they might seem to stand in need

be exposed to, and of their need of protection.

He added that the man “wasn’t resisting at all until they tased him”

The man was heard screaming in pain: “My fucking back is killing me! Oh

Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his

When Plummer went to the door, the soared kid fired a warning shot to fend
off the would-be burglars.
However, the shotgun b|ast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

before his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two
sons.

Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of
his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in
Indianapolis at the age of 26.

Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what
authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an off-
duty firefighter.

The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest
Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said.

Suddenly, Boxley said, a car out her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old
sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her
off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of
their cars.

At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a
gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley.

She said the man got inside his car but exited again and “he just started
shooting,” hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his
gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal
legally owned the gun and did not fire it.

Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began
shooting him.

“I was hoping my brother wasn’t dead,” said Boxley.

Beal’s mother said he was a father to two Children, a 4-year-old and a 2—year-
old, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother.

“This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They
have no consideration for life,” - Tiffaney Boxley.

Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will
say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own
death, armed or unarmed.

downtown Charleston.

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe
Street that’s being displaced by development says he’s doing it to make a
statement.

“It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something
that’s not done here by black folk,” said Joseph Wicks, who now owns the
house at 33 Woolfe St. “None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted
toward black folk.”

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods
because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of
home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.

The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it
can’t be torn down!

I’m so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can
protect our history!

Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented
various inmates and prison guards in Civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches
law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with
students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well.

cooked something else entirely dangerous—cocaine. As a teenager,
Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.
By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later
apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught
carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for
cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.

He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some
of LA’s top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing
many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land
a job at Caesar’s Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started
getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All
the fame and success hasn’t gotten to Henderson’s head though and he has
continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can
achieve in life with the right Choices.
